# Actual issue was not using the correct kernel on the remote ipython notebook instance, but this information is still useful so I'm saving this document anyway

# recurring error message while running keras LSTM model:
save_weights requires module h5py

h5py is installed, I can go into python and import it with no issues

these are all sugested solutions:
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/3426

sudo apt-get install python-h5py -- this one installed no problems python-h5py_2.2.1-1build2_amd64.deb
sudo pip install cython -- this one installed fine 0.25.2
sudo apt-get install libhdf5 -- "Unable to locate package libhdf5"
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev -- "libhdf5-dev is already the newest version"

ok so not really sure if anything I just did changed anything...



# so if you ever can't find a package in ubuntu, this might come in handy...
https://askubuntu.com/questions/148638/how-do-i-enable-the-universe-repository/148645#148645
not going to bother with this right now though..

# ok so I can't get a kernel to show up correctly properly and just tried testing out my ipython notebook with a quick print statement and it wouldn't show the output... something is not working correctly... I might need to just create a new notebook and copy paste all of the code snippets in

One thing it complains about is not having access to the same kernel that was used on the notebook when it was created
